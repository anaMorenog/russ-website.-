<p> Russ is a 24 yearold rapper,singer and producer from atlanta.He works with his friend bugus that he has know since childhood.
He developedan interest for music when he was seven-years-old.When he was the age of fourteen he started making his own beats.</p>
	
<p>He was a freshmen at kennesaw state university when he dropped out to focus on his music. Before he set up his soundcloud
he had already released 11 albums. His newest album is called "there's really a A wolf". One of nis most popular songs is "what they want"</p>
	<p>Growing up him and his family went through a lot of financial problems. his song "titantic" is all about how he worked hard for
his family to come up."Mama I been working, tryna get this money</p>
Tell Dad please don't worry, no one's going hungry.But I know this ship just keeps on sinking.Gotta' just keep on swimming." 
in these lyrics he shows and tells that even if things get hared you just have to push through it.
	<p>I first heard of him in the begging of the school year, freshmen year. I fell in-love with his song" losing control".
I would listen to him with my sister Alix all the time and i was very happy when she told me we would be going to the Russ
conert together. The show was absolutly amazing.</p>
	<p>I made this website for anyone who has not heard of him or any of his music. He is someone i really enjoy listing to
and i want to share him with as many people as i can. So if you havent heard of him. please give him a try. And if for some strange 
reason you dont like him i understand, hes not foreveryone. </p>
